'''VOT_290.py

VOT_290.py  - measure VOT in all of the stops in a given sound file (as
              found in files used by ling290 fall 2015).

Usage: VOT_290.py soundfile_name

Arguments:
  soundfile_name   a soundfile to be analyzed.
  
Assumption
    there is also a file soundfile_name.TextGrid that has a phone tier and a word tier

# This script uses the following functions from the ESPS library for speech processing
#   - hditem: get information from a wav or fea file header
#   - fft: spectral analysis, producing a single spectrum or a spectrogram
#   - melspec: convert an fft spectrum into a "Mel transformed" auditory spectrum
#   - pplain: print values from fea files (spectra) to plain text

# Read about these and other ESPS routines in the Berkeley Phonetics Machine 
# using the 'man' command.   For example:
#       > man fft 
# will show the manual page for the fft routine
