'''\nfricative_analysis.py
fricative_analysis.py: Do spectral analysis on fricative portions of soundfiles in specified directory tree.

Usage: fricative_analysis.py dirname

Arguments:
  dirname   Root of directory tree containing soundfiles to be analyzed.

fricative_analysis.py loops over all of the .wav files in a specified directory and all of
its subdirectories. It looks in the .wav files' associated textgrids (any textgrids with the
same name as the .wav file but with a .TextGrid extension) for a tier named 'phone', performs
spectral analysis during portions with a fricative label, and prints the analysis.

# This script uses the following functions from the ESPS library for speech processing
#   - hditem: get information from a wav or fea file header
#   - fft: spectral analysis, producing a single spectrum or a spectrogram
#   - melspec: convert an fft spectrum into a "Mel transformed" auditory spectrum
#   - pplain: print values from fea files (spectra) to plain text

# Read about these and other ESPS routines in the Berkeley Phonetics Machine 
# using the 'man' command.   For example:
#       > man fft 
# will show the manual page for the fft routine
